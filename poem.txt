2003: Thich Huyen Quang
by Ela Kosmaczewska
You build my cage.
        Smell your fear.
You bring your guns.
                Am not alone here.
You force me down.
                        Will rise back up.
You drown my song.
                                Refuse to give up.
You take my freedom.
                                        Beat my wings more.
                                                This frail man sings louder than ever before.
