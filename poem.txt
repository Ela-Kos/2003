2003: Thich Huyen Quang

You build my cage,

        I smell your fear.

You bring your guns,

        Iâ€™m not alone here.

You force me down,

        I rise back up.

You drown my song,

        I refuse to give up.

You take my freedom,

        I beat my wings more.

This frail man sings louder than ever before.
